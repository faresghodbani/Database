This repository contains SQL exercises and projects from my Computer Science studies at University Côte d’Azur.  
It covers topics such as:

- Database design and normalization

- Joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions
- Advanced SQL features and optimization

Each folder corresponds to a specific TP or project with its SQL scripts and example data.
